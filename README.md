📧 Add Emails Based on Codes – Excel VBA Script
This VBA macro automates the process of scanning a reference list in the "ITR" sheet and generating a unique list of email addresses based on embedded letter codes. The compiled list is then displayed in the "EMAIL" sheet.

✅ What It Does
Scans Column B in the "ITR" worksheet for predefined codes (e.g., "AB", "QA", "PM", etc.).

Matches each code to a set of predefined email addresses using a dictionary.

Compiles all matched email addresses into a single string.

Removes duplicate emails and provides a clean, unique list.

Outputs:

Full email list (with duplicates) in EMAIL!A1

Unique email list (no duplicates) in EMAIL!A2

📌 Example of Code Matching
If B2 contains the text "Inspection - QA-001" and B5 contains "AB-Form":

QA maps to qa9.team@checkmail.com

AB maps to test1.email@example.com

These emails will be added to the result list.

🧠 How It Works
Uses a dictionary object to store and retrieve emails for each code.

Uses InStr() to perform partial string matching on each cell in Column B.

Compiles results into a ; -separated string.

Splits the string and stores each address in another dictionary to ensure uniqueness.

✨ Benefits
No manual lookup or copying of emails.

Ensures accuracy by avoiding duplicate emails.

Makes it easy to send group emails or build dynamic distribution lists based on ITR content.

📋 Sample Output

Cell	Content
A1	Full email list including duplicates
A2	Clean list with only unique email addresses ready for copy/paste 📤
